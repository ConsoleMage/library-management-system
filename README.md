### 1. Introduction  

**Library Management System**  

You will create a simple library management system that stores up to five book titles using string variables. The system will allow users to add new books, remove a book, and display the list of available books.

Imagine you're a librarian managing a small collection of five books. You need a program that allows you to:

- Add books to the collection.

- Remove a book by its title.

- Display the current list of books available in the library.

With the help of Microsoft Copilot, you will build this program using string variables, conditional statements, and loops.
