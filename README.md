# library-management-system

This is the second peer-graded assignment, C# Coding With Microsoft Copilot, Course 2 of 12 of the Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate course.

### 1. Introduction  

**Library Management System**  

You will create a simple library management system that stores up to five book titles using string variables. The system will allow users to add new books, remove a book, and display the list of available books.

Imagine you're a librarian managing a small collection of five books. You need a program that allows you to:

- Add books to the collection.

- Remove a book by its title.

- Display the current list of books available in the library.

- Add a Search Feature*
  
- Limit Borrowing*
  
- Check-in a Borrowed Book*

With the help of Microsoft Copilot, you will build this program using string variables, conditional statements, and loops.

### 2. Testing / Debugging

With some help from the Visual Studio IDE, I was able to set breakpoints and initialize expressions I wanted to monitor while debugging. I found the debugging interface in Visual Studio IDE easy to use and developer-friendly.

### 3. Copilot

Adding new features to the application with Copilot through prompts was relatively easy, thanks to the integrated Copilot chat within the Visual Studio IDE. I had to discipline myself to first understand the code suggested by Copilot before integrating it into my project to avoid mistakes or introducing bugs that I might not understand later.
