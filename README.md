# library-management-system

This is the second peer-graded assignment for "C# Coding with Microsoft Copilot," which is Course 2 of 12 in the Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate program.

A project for creating a command-line application that can run on .NET on Windows, Linux and macOS.

### 1. Introduction  

**Library Management System**  

You will create a simple library management system that stores up to five book titles using string variables. The system will allow users to add new books, remove a book, and display the list of available books.

Imagine you're a librarian managing a small collection of five books. You need a program that allows you to:

- Add Books to the Collection
- Remove a Book by Its Title
- Display the Current List of Books Available in the Library
- Add a Search Feature*
- Limit Borrowing*
- Check-In a Borrowed Book*

With the help of Microsoft Copilot, you will build this program using string variables, conditional statements, and loops.

### 2. Debugging

With some help from Visual Studio Code, I was able to set breakpoints and initialize expressions I wanted to monitor while debugging. I found the debugging interface in Visual Studio Code easy to use and developer-friendly.

### 3. GitHub Copilot

Adding new features to the application with GitHub Copilot through prompts was relatively easy, thanks to the integrated GitHub Copilot chat within Visual Studio Code. I had to discipline myself to first understand the code suggested by GitHub Copilot before integrating it into my project to avoid mistakes or introducing bugs that I might not understand later.
